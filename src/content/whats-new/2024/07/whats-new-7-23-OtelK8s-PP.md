Analyzing OpenTelemetry and Prometheus metrics alongside the rest of your performance data typically requires significant expertise and effort to set up instrumentation and build custom dashboards. Then you have to manually correlate data across multiple screens.

Weâ€™ve eliminated these challenges, with native support for OpenTelemetry and Prometheus instrumented hosts and Kubernetes clusters, giving you easy instrumentation that populates native UIs with golden signals and automatically correlates application and infrastructure performance. This allows you to quickly identify and isolate issues using your preferred open source telemetry data in one place, without vendor lock-in.

It includes these capabilities:

* One-step instrumentation for Kubernetes clusters using the OpenTelemetry collector.
* One-step instrumentation for Prometheus Node Exporter.
* Native UIs populated with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus-generated golden signals.
* Automatic service and infrastructure relationship mapping to understand dependencies across your stack.
* Automatic correlation between OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications and infrastructure resources to understand how the performance of each layer impacts each other.
